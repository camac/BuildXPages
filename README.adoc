= BuildXPages

BuildXPages is a project which is useful if you are interested in Automating tasks that are involved in building XPages.

For example you may be interested in automating some of these tasks:

* Building NSFs from an On-Disk Project
* Building Plugins and Features
* Refreshing NSF Designs
* Setting Template Inheritance of NSFs
* Start, Stop and Restart Http server
* Uploading Plugins to an NSF Update Site
* Deploy Plugins to Notes/Designer

BuildXPages provides tools which can be used to achieve tasks like these.
The main artifact of the project is a collection of custom ANT Tasks, but it also provides a Domino Designer Plugin to help with Headless Building of NSFs
