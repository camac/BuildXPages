=== clearupdatesite

[NOTE]
====
This task does not refer to clearing an NSF update site, this task is for clearing and update site on the filesystem
====

After building plugins, sometimes you want to put them in an update site on the filesystem. You may want to make sure the update site is empty before you put your plugins there, so this task can clear out an existing update site.

==== Attributes

[horizontal]
eclipsedir:: The root folder that contains the plugins and features directory. I call it eclipse directory because often you will find it in the structure ../something/**eclipse**/plugins and ../something/**eclipse**/features

==== Example

include::../com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.ant/buildTest.xml[tag=clearupdatesite]
