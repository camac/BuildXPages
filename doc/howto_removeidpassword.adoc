== Removing a Password from Notes ID

In order for the Notes C API tasks to run smoothly, the ID file on the computer needs to have no password.

It goes without saying that this is a security risk but you can decide for yourself if you feel you can secure the computer so that nobody can access it. 

Alternatively, you can ensure that IBM Notes is running, in which case the automated tasks will _hopefully_ not be prompted for a password.

=== To Remove the Password

The ID file that you have been issued by an administrated must be created with settings that allow the password to be removed.

* Open IBM Notes, and make sure you are logged in with the user.id 
* File -> Security -> User Security
* Click Change Password
* If you don't see a 'No Password' button then you cannot remove the password because of policy or something

If you can't remove the password, then make sure you will always keep IBM Notes running and logged in, and that you tick the *Don't Prompt for a password from other Notes-based programs (reduces security)*
