= Notes ID Password

In order for the Notes C API tasks to run they must use a Notes ID.

The easiest option is to make the ID file have no password. It goes without saying that this is a security risk but you can decide for yourself if you feel you can secure the computer so that nobody can access it. 

== To Remove the Password

The ID file that you have been issued by an administrated must be created with settings that allow the password to be removed.

* Open IBM Notes, and make sure you are logged in with the user.id 
* File -> Security -> User Security
* Click Change Password
* If you don't see a 'No Password' button then you cannot remove the password because of policy or something

== Alternative to Password Removal

Alternatively, you can ensure that IBM Notes is running and logged in. In this case the automated tasks will _hopefully_ not be prompted for a password if you tick the *Don't Prompt for a password from other Notes-based programs (reduces security)* in your Notes Login and Password Settings
