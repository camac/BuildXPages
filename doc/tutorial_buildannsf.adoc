== Getting Started - Build an NSF

In this tutorial we will take a Simple XPages Application that exists as on On-Disk Project, and build it using Domino Designer Headless Plugin.

After the successful build, the nsf will be available in your local workspace.

=== Install Build4XPages Headless Designer Plugin

If you haven't yet installed the Headless Designer plugin

=== Install Build4XPages ANT Library

=== Run the Build

The files for this Demonstration are in the *demo/buildnsf* folder of the Build4XPages distribution.

1. Open your command line
2. Change directory to the the *demo/buildnsf* folder
3. issue the command `ant`

The build process will then begin, and your nsf will be built into your local workspace.

Lets have a look at what will happen by following along with the build script.
