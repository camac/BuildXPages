== Building an NSF
:imagesdir: ./images

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before doing this tutorial make sure you have performed necessary setup detailed in the *gettingstarted* page
====

In this tutorial we will build a Simple XPages Application from an on On-Disk Project, using Domino Designer Headless Plugin + BuildXPages Ant Tasks.

After the successful build, the nsf will be available in your local workspace.

The files for this Demonstration are in the *demo/buildnsf* folder of the Build4XPages distribution files. The sample On-Disk Project is located within the tutorial folder as *sampleodp*. 
The Application has a Custom Control and an XPage which uses that custom control.

=== build.xml

Our 'recipe' for the build is contained in the *build.xml* file located in the *demo/buildnsf* directory. *build.xml* is the default name for an Ant build file, you can call it another filename but if so you would need to specify extra command line argument `-b myfile.xml`

Within the build.xml file are things called _targets_. A target is a bit like a code block.
Targets can be configured to depend on another target, so that means executing a _target_ will cause the other targets that it depends on to be executed first.

Within this build.xml file are 2 _targets_ that are used to setup the demo *clean* and *init*

*clean* is used to clean up any previous attempt at this tutorial, and *init* is used to initialise a new attempt.

You can see that *init* has been set to depend on *clean* so that before the *init* target is executed, the *clean* target will be executed.

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/buildnsf/build.xml[tag=clean]
----

=== Run a Successful Build

Within this *build.xml* file is a target called *build*. This will build the NSF that should not have any problems.
This target is listed as the default target in the root element of the build.xml file (not shown here).

This target makes use of the *bxp:buildnsf* task which will connect to the Headless Designer Plugin, and instruct it to build the nsf as specified by the task attributes.

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/buildnsf/build.xml[tag=build]
----

You can see that this target depends on *init*. *init* depends on clean, so when we execute this *build* target what will really happen is the following order of execution:

    clean -> init -> build

==== To run the Build

1. Open your command line
2. Change directory to the the *demo/buildnsf* folder
3. issue the command `ant`

Ant knows to look for *build.xml* and the default target (which is our *build* target). 
The build process will then begin, and your nsf will (hopefully) be built into your local workspace.

You should see some output on the console like so:
[source,txt]
----
Buildfile: V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\build.xml

clean:
   [delete] Deleting directory V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odp
   [delete] Deleting directory V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odperror

init:
     [copy] Copying 20 files to V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odp
     [copy] Copying 20 files to V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odperror

build:

[bxp:buildnsf] BUILD JOB STATUS: SUCCESS
[bxp:buildnsf] PROBLEMS STATUS: SUCCESS
[bxp:buildnsf] No ProblemMarkers found after Building

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds
----

Also, in your domino Designer workspace you should see a new NSF with filepath temp\BuildXPagesDemo.nsf

==== Run a Build with Errors

Let's see an example of running an NSF Build that results in some errors. To do this we will use the same sample On-Disk Project, but before we run the build we will sneakily delete the custom controls.
This should cause an error when Designer tries to build the XPages that use those missing custom controls.

The _target_ that I have written to do this is called *buildfail*. 

Note it is pretty much the same as *build* but is pointing to a different location for the on-disk project, and specifies different NSF and projectname.

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/buildnsf/build.xml[tag=buildfail]
----

Since it is not the default target, we will tell ant that that is the target we want to build by including the target name in the command line arguments.

1. issue the command `ant buildfail'

You should then see an output like so:

[source,txt]
----
Buildfile: V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\build.xml

clean:
   [delete] Deleting directory V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odp
   [delete] Deleting directory V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odperror

init:
     [copy] Copying 20 files to V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odp
     [copy] Copying 20 files to V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odperror

buildfail:
[bxp:buildnsf] Attempt to Create Socket
[bxp:buildnsf] Socket Created
[bxp:buildnsf] CONNECTED TO DESIGNER! What can we do for you?
[bxp:buildnsf] Issuing Refresh Import Build Command for V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildnsf\odperror\.project
[bxp:buildnsf] BUILD JOB ABOUT TO RUN
[bxp:buildnsf] BUILD JOB RUNNING
[bxp:buildnsf] BUILD JOB STATUS: SUCCESS
[bxp:buildnsf] PROBLEMS STATUS: FAIL
[bxp:buildnsf] The following ProblemMarkers were present after building
[bxp:buildnsf] Error: Home.xsp: The unknown tag xc:ccCustomControl cannot be used as a control.
----

Notice that the 'PROBLEMS STATUS' is fail and the last line is telling us the exact problem.
If you were to look in Designer you would see the problem there too.
