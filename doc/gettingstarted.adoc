== Getting Started

In order to use the BuildXPages there is a little bit of setup to be done.
This section will hopefully guide you through the process. Please let me know via an Issue on the Github Project page if anything was left out.

=== First Time Setup Tasks

* Install IBM Notes/Designer (This is assumed!)
* Install a JDK
* Install Ant
* Install the BuildXPages ANT Task Library
* Install Eclipse
* Setup Environment Variables
* Install the Headless Designer Plugin to Notes/Designer
* Remove the Password from the Notes ID
