= Install Ant
:imagesdir: images

We will be using Apache Ant as our main build tool, so we need to install it!

== Download Ant

Installing Ant is a matter of downloading and extracting Ant to your desired location

Go to http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi and download the appropriate archive.
For Example, I am on a windows machine so I will download the zip archive.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ant version 1.10 requires Java 8, Although this may work with Notes FP8 and later, I recommend sticking with version 1.9.x due to the likelihood of having to run it using a Java 6 runtime, and the fact that I haven't tested BuildXPages with Ant 1.10 yet.

=== Extract the Downloaded Archive

Extract your download ant archive to it's final destination. I usually put it in a directory called `ant` in the root, and keep it with it's version name
`C:\ant\apache-ant-1.9.9`

=== Setup Environment Variables

Add Ant's *bin* directory (e.g. C:\ant\apache-ant-1.9.9\bin) to your PATH Environment variable. This will enable you to be able to run the command `ant` from anywhere

==== Set ANT_HOME Environment Variables

Add an *ANT_HOME* Environment Variable that points to Ant's home directory

==== Set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable to Notes JRE

Ant is a java program that runs within a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK).
Usually you would install and configure a JDK for Ant to be run on.
The common way to tell Ant where to find the JRE/JDK is to use the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable.

Some of BuildXPages tasks require the Notes Java API, and these tasks need access to the Notes Java Libraries and also a compatible environment. The easiest method here is to set JAVA_HOME to point to the JRE which is provided by IBM Notes, as this should already have all the necessary libraries on the class path.

If you are running any other Java programs that utilise JAVA_HOME, then maybe they will be affected by this. I leave it up to you to decide on this! 

So we can simply add this JVM as the JAVA_HOME

Be aware that with IBM Notes FP8 and greater, there are 2 JVMs 

* %NOTES_PROGDIR%\jvm
* %NOTES_PROGDIR%\jvm1.6

You should be fine with using either but let me know if I'm wrong!

=== Verify Installation

Once you have everything setup, it is time to test it out
Open up a fresh Command Prompt, and type
```
ant -version
```

If everything is fine you should see output similar to this (but with your version and maybe a different date):
