=== configuredynamicplugins

This task configures IBM Notes' **platform.xml** file so that IBM Notes will load plugins from the filesystem without the need to 'approve' them via the User Interface.

Usually you need to go through the whole provisioning process for plugin updates, but this task will put IBM Notes into a configuration that bypasses this.
