== Getting Started with BuildXPages Ant Library

To use the BuildXPages Ant libary you first need to have Ant Installed!

You have 2 choices of how to run ANT, you can run it from within Eclipse or run it from the Command Line. 
When you are developing your ANT Scripts, it is quite helpful to run them from Eclipse as there is a nicer user interface.
When you deploy your ANT Scripts to be run automatically, they will most likely be run from the command line. Read on to see instructions for both

=== Using ANT within Eclipse IDE

If you are developing using Eclipse IDE, then you already have Ant Built right in to Eclipse.

To use the BuildXPages Library, you can make the library available to every ant project, or if you prefere you can make the library available just each individual project that needs it.

==== Installing for all projects

When ANT runs, there are 2 locations in which it will check for additional libraries. You should put BuildXPages.jar and JNA

${user.home}/.ant/lib::
Libraries installed here will be available for the user who's home directory it is.
For example my user directory on windows is *C:\Users\Cameron\.ant\lib*
The Benefit of installing libraries here is that they will be available for both Ant in eclipse, and ant on the command line.
ANT_HOME/lib::
Libraries installed here will be available for all users. For example on windows, if you have installed ant to *C:\ant*, then any libraries present in the *C:\ant\lib* directory will be available to be used.

==== Installing for a Single project

If you don't want to install to the global library locations, you can just make it available for your single project.

Create a directory in your project called lib
Put the BuildXPages.jar in that location

when running ant, you will need to specify the library location with -lib command
