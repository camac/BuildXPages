=== unpackplugin

Usually you update Domino Designer with new plugins by going through the normal installation process. But there is another way in which you can build plugins into a particular folder, and Domino Designer always picks up new versions.

When deploying plugins this way, some plugins need to be 'unpacked' which means they don't exist as a jar file, but the contents are unpacked into a folder.

This task will unpack a plugin to a folder with the same name as the plugin. You only need to specify the plugin name, and it will find the version information automatically

==== Attributes

[horizontal]
dir:: The directory that the plugin is in
pluginid:: the plugin id that you want to unpack

==== Example

include::../com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.ant/buildTest.xml[tag=unpackplugin]
