== Deploying Plugins

[IMPORTANT]
====
This tutorial is designed to be completed after the successful completion of the buildfeature tutorial.
====

After building your plugins, now you might want to deploy to either:

* A Domino Server
* IBM Notes / Designer Client

=== Preparing an Update Site

At the end of the headless feature build process, you will have a .zip file of your plugins and features. The contents of your zip file will be something like:

[tree,file="images/teset.png"]
--
|--eclipse
|  |--plugins
|  |  |--com.your.plugin.jar
|  |--features
|  |  |--com.your.feature.jar
--

Unfortunately although this format looks a bit like an Update Site, it isn't quite there yet.
We are missing is the **site.xml** file, which is a list of the features that can be found in the update site.
So what we are going to do is to extract the contents of the zip and then generate our site.xml
We will then have an update site! We will also create a *.zip* version of this update site.

The steps necessary for this are contained within the **prepareupdatesite** target in our 
tutorial's build.xml file.

There are 3 tasks in this target

unzip:: Unzips the contents of the built plugins zip to a local directory. Note we are also removing the leading 'eclipse' directory as we are not interested in keeping that
bxp:generatesitexml:: This is our custom task from the BuildXPages library which will generate the site.xml file that we need to make this an update site
zip:: This will create a zip of our update site so that we have this as another option for easy distribution as a single file 

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=prepareupdatesite]
----

Lets have a look at the properties that this task depends on. We see we have defined whereabouts to find the built plugins zip, and we define the name of our update site that we are creating.

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=properties]
----

Also note our target depends on the *clean* target, so lets have a look at that target.
This target simply deletes the output of any previous run of this task.

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=clean]
----

Lets give this a go by issuing the command
```
ant prepareupdatesite
```

You should see some output similar to this:

[source,txt]
----
Buildfile: V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\deployplugins\build.xml

clean:

prepareupdatesite:
    [unzip] Expanding: V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\buildfeature\buildDirectory\BuildXPagesDemo\com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.demo.feature-1.zip into V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\deployplugins\com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.demo.updatesite
[bxp:generatesitexml] File saved!
      [zip] Building zip: V:\Projects\BuildXPages\demo\deployplugins\com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.demo.updatesite.zip

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
----

And if you look in the tutorial folder, you should see 2 new entries which is our built update site in both directory and archive format

* a new directory com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.demo.updatesite
* a new zip file com.gregorbyte.buildxpages.demo.updatesite.zip

=== Deploying to Domino Server

The main 2 options you have for Deploying plugins to a server are:

* Copy the Features and Plugins to the <dominoData>/workspace/applications update site
* Deploy to an NSF Update Site

My preferred method of deploying plugins to a server is to use an Update Site NSF. The advantage is that this NSF Update site can replicate to other servers, and that means you only have to deploy to your primary server. Another advantage is that you can delete older versions of plugins whilst the server is still running. 

Otherwise if you are deploying to the filesystem of every server you may have a tricky time accessing each server remotely, also you cannot delete plugins that are in use when the server is running. It can be an option though if you are deploying to a local testing server

==== Deploying to an NSF Update Site

IBM provides a standard template for the NSF Update Site, however the standard template requires a user to manually import an update site using the IBM Notes Client.

If you want to be able to automatically import plugins you will need to use the Open Eclipse Update Site which is the same template with a minor modification made to allow the plugins to be imported headlessly. The modification provides an agent which can be run to import an update site to the NSF update site.

BuildXPages provides an Ant task which will run this agent for us. The task is called *importplugins*

Our tutorial has a target which will do this for us, but we just need to tell it the server and database of the update site to import to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To perform this part of the tutorial you will need to have set up an Open Eclipse Update Site
Make sure you change these properties to the server and database that you have set up.
====

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=nsfupdatesiteproperties]
----

Here is the target that we will run that executes the importplugins task using the properties set above (and the previously mentioned *updateSiteName* property from earlier in the tutorial). 

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=importdominoplugins]
----

[NOTE]
====
We have set the *deletefirst* attribute as 'false', but you can set this to 'true' if you would like the entire contents of the NSF Update Site deleted before you import. This would mean that after the import, only the features and plugin that import here are contained in the NSF Update Site.
====

Lets run the target and see what happens

```
ant importdominoplugins
```

You should see some output like this:

[source,txt]
----
TODO
----

Ignore the errors, they always show up and I have never been bothered enough to fix that, the end result though is you should see these plugins and features in your NSF Update Site

image::..\images\NSFUpdateSiteImported.JPG[]

Assuming that your server is configured to load plugins from this update site, you now just need to restart the http server and the new plugins should load. 

We can do this using BuildXPages *controlhttp* task

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=restarthttp]
----

[CAUTION]
====
In practice, restarting http in a production system should be done in a deliberate manner at previously communicated times. Use this task appropriately! Personally I only use this task for User Acceptance Testing servers, and rely on a scheduled domino program entry that restarts http in the dead of the night, scheduled after the design task will have refreshed any templates.

=== Deploying to Domino Designer

If you are building NSFs headlessly then you may need to be able to automatically install the plugins to Domino Designer. Another reason may be that you want to automate this process for your developer machine, because it can get quite annoying to have to frequently update your own Designer Client with latest versions of the plugins that you are working on.

In any case here are some techinques to deploy plugnis to Designer.

==== Deploying Manually

===== Selecting from the Filesystem

Follow your usual steps to import an update site and just choose either the directory or archive version of the update site that we just built!

===== Continual Refresh from NSF Update Site

If you are already importing these plugins to an NSF update site, you can set your Notes/Designer client up so it can check the NSF for latest Updates. 

Just go to File -> Application -> Install and then choose search for new features to install
Make sure your previously used NSF Update Site Location is selected and then click finish. It should discover the new versions of your feature

==== Deploying to 'dropins' style Designer Plugins Directory

There is a method which was previously communicated by Niklas Heidloff when he was working as a developer evangelist for XPages.

The method basically involves making some edits to a 'platform.xml' file, and also setting up a 'link' file which points to an update site. There is one caveat that the update site must contain the root directory 'eclipse'

BuildXPages provides 2 tasks that help to do all this for you. They are both utilised in the *configuredesigner* target

configureDynamicPlugins:: will edit the *platform.xml* to allow this dynamic loading of plugins
initDesignerSite:: will set up the link file to point to the update site that we want to load during startup of designer

[source,xml]
----
include::../demo/deployplugins/build.xml[tag=configuredesigner]
----

lets run this target

```
ant configuredesigner
```

Now when we start Designer it should load our plugins! And we didn't have to go through all that provisioning operations.

==== Deploying using the Headless Designer Plugin

[NOTE]
====
This functionality is not yet complete but is next on my list

=== Conclusion

Hopefully this tutorial has demonstrated some of the tasks that you can use to get your plugins where you need them to be! Let me know if you have any questions or suggested improvements to this tutorial.
